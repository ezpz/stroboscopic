This started as a simple tool to generate a random layout for a pyrography 
project I was working on. The goal of the project was to rotate a circular
piece of wood under a strobe light. The wood had a pattern burned into it 
that would look random when the disc was stationary but form a specific image 
when rotated at a particular speed under a strobe light (stroboscopic effect). 

I wanted a way to: 
 * visualize what the board would look like stationary
 * visualize what pattern would look like when rotated
 * generate a random layout given a particular pattern

I used the Allegro graphics library for the visualizations and - for a 
simple pattern - things are functional. 

It is unclear at this point how much further I am going to push the project.
